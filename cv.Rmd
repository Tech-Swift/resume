aboutme: >
  I am a passionate web developer with a focus on full-stack development using
  the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js). My journey began with
  hands-on learning and project-based practice, where I built applications that
  strengthened my problem-solving, debugging, and collaboration skills.
  Today, I enjoy designing and developing clean, scalable, and user-centered
  applications that solve real-world challenges. Looking ahead, I am eager to
  continue growing as a versatile developer, contribute to impactful projects,
  and collaborate with teams to deliver innovative digital solutions that
  create meaningful value.
